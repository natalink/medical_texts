Yoga is a mental and physical practice with origins in ancient Indian philosophy [1]. Previous research based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has suggested that yoga may reduce low back pain [2], improve vitality in breast cancer patients, and reduce inflammatory cytokines [3]. In recent years, prenatal yoga has also been reported to reduce psychiatric stress and anxiety [4,5] low back pain [6], pregnancy complications in high-risk patients (such as those with obesity or advanced age) [7], and the duration of labor in healthy pregnant women [8]. The beneficial effects of prenatal yoga have been previously summarized elsewhere [9].Two RCTs have also investigated the effects of yoga on neonatal prematurity: a study from the US reported significantly longer mean gestational durations in women who practiced yoga (yoga group, mean (SD), 38.6 (1.9) weeks; non-yoga group, 36.7 (2.6) weeks) [10]. Similarly, a study from India observed a significantly lower prevalence of preterm births (yoga group, 20.7%; control group, 45.7%) among women with high-risk factors such as history of obstetric complications, obesity, or advanced age [7]. However, studies have yet to examine the effects of prenatal yoga on prematurity or tocolytic drug use in pregnant Japanese women [9], and there is currently little evidence to support the practice of prenatal yoga in Japan.Preterm birth is a major contributing factor to perinatal morbidity and mortality [11,12]. Drugs such as β2-agonists are frequently administered throughout the world (particularly in developing countries) to treat preterm labor [13], which if left untreated can lead to spontaneous preterm birth. Despite evidence supporting the effectiveness of betamimetics in reducing the number of women in preterm labor who give birth within 48 hours, these drugs have not been observed to actually reduce the incidence of preterm births [13]. Due to the relatively high risk of adverse effects and the lack of effectiveness in preventing preterm births, the usage of betamimetics tends to be avoided, particularly among developed countries [13,14].The proportion of preterm births in Japan is among the lowest in the world [15–17]. The key drug for treating preterm labor in Japan is ritodrine hydrochloride, which is a β-agonist [18–20]. While the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved another tocolytic agent (magnesium sulfate) for the treatment of preterm labor in 2008, its use is restricted to cases that are unresponsive to ritodrine hydrochloride. As a result, ritodrine hydrochloride remains the de facto first-line drug for preterm labor in Japan [19]. Despite its widespread use, ritodrine hydrochloride places a substantial burden on the cardiovascular system [21] and may also result in other adverse effects[22–25], indicating that it should only be administered when necessary. Hence, identifying alternative options that can contribute to a decrease in ritodrine hydrochloride use would be beneficial for pregnant women. In this study, we investigated the use of prenatal yoga as a possible alternative to reduce preterm labor in pregnant women.This observational study aimed to clarify the association between prenatal yoga and the use of ritodrine hydrochloride during pregnancy.
