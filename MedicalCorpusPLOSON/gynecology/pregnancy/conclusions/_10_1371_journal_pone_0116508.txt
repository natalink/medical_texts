Overall, our analysis represents a significant advancement towards understanding the underlying molecular heterogeneity of preeclampsia. Similar large-scale approaches could also be taken for other major pathologies of pregnancy, such as intra-uterine growth restriction and gestational diabetes myelitis. Moving forward, it will be essential to confirm and expand on these results with additional large-scale studies, an effort under way in our groups. Future emphasis should be on linking histopathology with gene expression data, and identifying and classifying patients early in diagnosis, likely through testing serum samples for panels of genes unique to each cluster. It is likely that current molecular diagnostics, such as sFLT1 and sENG, may efficiently select the “canonical” PE subclass. There is therefore a need to focus on the other two clusters, as placental gene expression cannot readily separate the preeclamptics from controls.
