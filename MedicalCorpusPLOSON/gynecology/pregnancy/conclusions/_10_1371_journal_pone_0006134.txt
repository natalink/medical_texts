Pulse wave analysis is a non-invasive method of assessing arterial stiffness and other central hemodynamics. [1]–[3] It has become a valuable clinical tool outside pregnancy, particularly in the assessment of conditions such as renal disease, diabetes and atherosclerosis, which have cardiovascular effects. [4]–[10] However, experience in pregnant women is still limited. Early work suggests that this technique could prove valuable in the diagnosis and management of pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. [11]–[13] However, until now, normal values for pregnancy have not been established.Current obstetric practice relies on the measurement of peripheral blood pressure, but central pressure may be more valuable in understanding both cardiac and vascular pathophysiology. The use of sphygmomanometry - which provides only the peak pressure of systole and the nadir of diastole - means that much of the information contained in the shape of the arterial waveform is lost.Two previous studies have investigated arterial pulse wave parameters in normal human pregnancy. [14], [15] Only one of these studies [15] provided data for the first trimester but the earliest examination was performed at 11 weeks of gestation which corresponds to the end of the third month of pregnancy. In the other [14], only 20 women were studied in each of the three gestational age groups, i.e. 17–20 weeks, 25–28 weeks, and 33–36 weeks of gestation. Mean values were calculated for all data in a given gestational age window; no longitudinal data for individual women were given. Neither study provided longitudinal data and neither explored the potential effect of ethnicity on pulse wave analysis parameters.Recent studies using pulse wave analysis have confirmed reduced arterial compliance, i.e. increased arterial stiffness, in women with clinically established pre-eclampsia. [11], [12], [16] So far, no study has compared PWA parameters earlier in pregnancy in women who later developed pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension with those who remained normotensive throughout pregnancy. If arterial pulse wave analysis is to be used clinically for the assessment and possibly the early screening of pre-eclampsia, normal values throughout pregnancy must first be established.The aims of this study were to evaluate the changes in pulse wave analysis parameters in normal pregnancy and to investigate whether these parameters are affected by ethnicity.
