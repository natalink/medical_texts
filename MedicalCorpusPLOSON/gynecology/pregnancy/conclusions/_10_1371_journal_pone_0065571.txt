Preeclampsia (PE) complicates about 5% of all pregnancies worldwide and is a major cause of maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, especially in developing nations [1], [2]. It is a potentially dangerous complication of the second half of pregnancy, labor, or early period after delivery, characterized by hypertension, abnormal amounts of protein in the urine, and other systemic disturbances. PE currently has little effective therapy, though it largely resolves after placenta and fetus delivery [3]. PE is one of the most common reasons for induced preterm delivery [4].The use of biofluid (e.g. serum or urine) for the analysis of the naturally occurring peptidome (MW<4000) as a source of biomarkers has been reported in different diseases [5]â€“[9]. For clinical application, mass spectrometry-based profiling of naturally occurring peptides can provide an extensive inventory of serum peptides derived from either high-abundant endogenous circulating proteins or cell and tissue proteins [10]. These peptides are usually soluble, and stable from endogenous proteases or peptidases, and can be directly used for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis without additional manipulation (e.g. tryptic digests). However, a serum peptidomics based approach has not been attempted for the discovery of PE biomarkers.We hypothesized that there would be differential serum peptidomic signatures reflective of a PE-specific alteration of proteolytic and anti-proteolytic pathways. Our peptidomics-based discovery and subsequent validation yielded 19 unique serum peptides differing between PE and control subjects. These peptide biomarkers, collectively as a panel, can effectively assess PE.
