Podocyturia, nephrinuria, or albuminuria does not appear to be reliable markers to predict PE, though a “normal” alb/Cr may be useful to help rule out disease. We realize our notation of a relatively low sensitivity and specificity is not conclusive, but given the discrepancy of these observations to studies published prior to them, we suggest further studies are warranted. Currently, some underscore complex pathophysiology of the disease, suggesting different pathomechanisms especially between early and late PE, and suggest it is unlikely that any single test or cell type will be able to predict PE, while others disagree [23]. If the former view prevails, a panel of biomarkers reflective of this complexity may be ideal for diagnosis.
