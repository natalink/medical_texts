No one risk-factors alone or unspecific combinations reached an acceptable accuracy, and â‰¥3 moderate risk combinations are needed in those without major risk-factors to reach a LR+> 10. Consequently, current approach based exclusively in OR, might be associated with inefficient specialist referral and unnecessary treatment with LDA. The prediction of PE was improved with a more individualized approach, by identifying specific combinations or by defining a differential cut-off to the distribution of the predicted probability for multiparous and nulliparous obtained by multiple regression analysis. However, the absence of any single neither relevant combinations were enough to rule-out the disease. The identification of such specific subgroups can improve the reliability of LDA prescription, but those with any single risk might need further screening. Our results contribute to a more personalized risk estimation of preeclampsia.
