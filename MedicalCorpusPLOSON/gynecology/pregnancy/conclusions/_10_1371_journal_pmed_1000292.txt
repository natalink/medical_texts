Pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, small for gestational age (SGA) pregnancies, and placental abruption are distressing and often devastating pregnancy outcomes for women, their families, and society [1]–[3]. Frequently occurring as a result of placental insufficiency, they affect more than one in 20 pregnancies [3],[4]. Thrombophilia describes an increased tendency to develop thrombosis, either venous or arterial. Thrombophilias may either be inherited or acquired and include protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, and the less potent factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin gene mutation (PGM). The combined prevalence of these thrombophilias in the general population exceeds one in ten [5]–[11]. A successful pregnancy requires the development of adequate placental circulation. It is hypothesised that thrombophilias may increase the risk of placental insufficiency because of placental micro- and/or macro-vascular thrombosis, as well as effects on trophoblast growth and differentiation [12].Individual case control studies variably demonstrate an association between the placenta-mediated pregnancy complications and thrombophilia but when meta-analysed suggest a weak positive association [13]–[15]. Case control studies are limited by (1) retrospective data collection leading to potential bias in outcome classification and incomplete and/or poor confounder data acquisition and (2) possible differential participation bias where more severe cases are recruited. Prospective cohort studies limit these potential biases but have limited power to detect weak associations [16]. Prospective cohort studies also provide absolute risk estimates that can be used to counsel patients. Our objective was to undertake a systematic review and a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to estimate the risk of these common and important placenta-mediated pregnancy complications in the women with and without FVL or PGM.
