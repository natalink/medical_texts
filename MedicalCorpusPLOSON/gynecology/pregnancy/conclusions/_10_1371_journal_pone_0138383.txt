In conclusion, epigenetic changes induced by pregnancy-related complications in placental tissue may cause later onset of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in offspring.Placental functions influence placenta itself, as well as the mother and the developing fetus, establishing a likely role in developmental programming of the fetus [141]. Alterations in blood vessel formation during placental development has the potential to reduce blood flow, leading to reduced nutrient delivery and an environment of fetal undernutrition. Fetal nutrition, or the supply of metabolic substrates delivered for growth and development, contributes to immediate, intermediate, and long-term health [142]. Immediate health consequences include intrauterine growth restriction and low birthweight. Childhood obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are the most common intermediate and long-term health consequences of fetal undernutrition [143]. Some authors postulate that early fetal and infant environment is strongly predictive for the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases later in life [143â€“147].The main pathways by which preeclampsia or pregnancy-related complications serve to modify vascular risk would appear to be hypoxia, antiangiogenesis, endothelial dysfunction and immune modifications. These pathways individually, synergistically, or cumulatively appear to alter the epigenetic potential of placenta itself including microRNA expression profile. And so the exposition to a preeclampsia or pregnancy-related complication environment in utero leads to altered phenotype after birth [147].
