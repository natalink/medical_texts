Small numbers of maternal cells, acquired during fetal life, persist into adult life in healthy individuals as microchimerism [1], [2]. This microchimeric population of cells is partially genetically foreign to the person who harbors them, as the cells also express non-inherited maternal antigens (NIMA). Durable effects of NIMA have been described in later life tolerance to organ grafts as well as in susceptibility to some diseases [3], [4]. These observations raise the interesting question whether the microchimerism a woman harbors from her mother can impact either the course or outcome of her own pregnancies.To our knowledge, microchimerism from a woman's own mother has not been studied during the course of pregnancy. We therefore conducted longitudinal studies of microchimerism from a woman's mother across gestational age in healthy pregnancies. To further explore a possible role for microchimerism from a woman's mother in maternal adaptation to pregnancy, we also sought to determine whether detection of microchimerism differed in the pregnancy complication preeclampsia, which is characterized by maternal immune dysfunction [5], [6].Because a pregnant woman acquires another population of cells from the fetus during pregnancy [7], the current studies encompass three generations with more than one mother-child relationship. For clarity in discussion we will refer to the pregnant woman as the proband (P), to the mother of the pregnant woman as the mother of the proband (MP), and the child as the child of the proband, or fetus. Microchimerism from a woman's own mother will be referred to as MP microchimerism.
