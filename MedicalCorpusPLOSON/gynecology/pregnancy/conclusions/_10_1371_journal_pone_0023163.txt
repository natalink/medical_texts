Preterm birth is an important public health issue in the UK and internationally, since prematurity is a major contributor to infant mortality and inequalities in health [1], [2], [3], [4]. Preterm birth rates are rising in countries such as the UK, the US and the Scandinavian countries over the past 20 years, under the influence of factors such as assisted conception and increasing maternal age in pregnancy [3]. The aetiology of preterm birth is complex, and previous studies have identified a plethora of individual and environmental level factors as being important in the pathway to preterm births [5], [6], [7]. A number of recurring socio-demographic, obstetric and medical risk factors have been identified, including socio-economic status (SES) [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]ENREF6. Understanding the relationship of these factors is central to designing effective prevention strategies [4], [13].There is increasing interest in the UK in publishing and comparing clinical outcomes across centres [14], but these comparisons are likely to be confounded by socioeconomic and other case-mix factors. An objective in this study was to better understand the influence of SES on risk of preterm birth in one of the most socially deprived urban areas in the UK, and to explore the effect of SES on both low and high risk populations. A recent study by Smith et al. concluded that almost 80% of the relative deprivation gap in all cause neonatal mortality is due to premature birth and congenital anomalies and stated that “Understanding the link between deprivation and preterm birth should be a major research priority to identify interventions to reduce preterm birth” [4]. It has been hypothesised that the mechanism linking low SES to preterm birth may be explained by the clustering of individual level risk factors in women from more disadvantaged backgrounds [6], [8]. In order to explore the relationship between SES and preterm birth it is necessary to account for these factors in the analysis. For instance, in another recent study Smith et al demonstrated higher rates of very preterm birth across deprivation quintiles in the Trent region, but they were unable to explore aetiological factors such as cigarette smoking, ethnicity, and history of previous preterm birth [15].Since the aetiology of preterm birth is significantly different in multiple pregnancies, women with a previous history of preterm birth, and following intrauterine transfers to tertiary obstetric units, we aimed to explore the effect of SES in singleton, booked pregnancies regarded clinically as either high or low risk. Our a priori hypothesis was that there would be differential rates of preterm birth by socioeconomic status, and that these might be related to individual level risk factors. We show that deprivation is indeed an important risk factor in low risk pregnancies, and that this is related to maternal smoking and underweight.
