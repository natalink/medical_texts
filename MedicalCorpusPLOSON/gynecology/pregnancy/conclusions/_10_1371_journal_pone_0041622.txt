Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder occurring after 20 weeks of gestation. It constitutes a significant public health problem in both industrialized and developing countries, contributing to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. PE affects between five to ten percent of pregnancies [1], [2]. The impact of the condition, however, is thought to be more severe in developing countries. The prevalence of PE in developing countries has been estimated between 1.8% and 16.7% [3] with at least 16% of maternal deaths resulting from PE [4].In spite of the detrimental effects of PE on maternal and neonatal outcomes, understanding the etiology and mechanisms of the disease remains a major challenge. Evidence compiled from controlled studies has shown that potential risk factors for PE include a family or personal history of PE, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, pre-existing diabetes, multiple pregnancies, nulliparity, hypertension or raised blood pressure at antenatal visits, increased body mass index (BMI) before or during pregnancy and advanced maternal age (greater than 40 years of age) [5], [6]. Similarly, there is evidence that the risk of PE increases with an interval of 10 years or more between pregnancies, autoimmune disease, renal disease, and chronic hypertension [5].The relative importance of risk factors leading to the occurrence of PE depends on the level of socioeconomic development reached by a given society [7]. In developing countries, the fast socioeconomic transition and the adoption of a Westernized lifestyle have increased the exposure to a high-saturated fat diet, sedentary lifestyles, smoking and psychosocial stress. These factors result in the development of obesity, hypertension and changes in carbohydrate metabolism that may be associated with the epidemic of cardio-metabolic diseases in these countries from an early age [7]â€“[9]. The factors mentioned above put women of childbearing age at a higher risk for the development of a spectrum of multiple diseases from anovulation [10] to gestational diabetes [11] and PE [12]. Little research has been conducted to specifically identify risk factors for the occurrence of PE among pregnant women in developing countries. Understanding which factors can be prevented or controlled within a population under rapid social, economic and structural changes is of crucial importance from a public health perspective [13]. The aim of this study was to identify which risk factors are associated with the development of PE among Colombian women.
