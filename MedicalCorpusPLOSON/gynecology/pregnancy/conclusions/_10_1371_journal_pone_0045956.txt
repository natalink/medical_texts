The high temperature requirement A (HtrA) proteases are a well conserved family of serine proteases identified in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals [1]. HtrAs are known to have important functions in protecting cells from stress conditions such as heat shock, oxidative stress, inflammation, ischemia/reperfusion and cancer [2].To date, there are four mammalian HtrA homologues identified [1]. The first three members (HtrA1, HtrA2/Omi, HtrA3) have been cloned and investigated for expression and function [3]. The fourth HtrA (HtrA4) has only recently been characterised [2], [4].HtrA3 was initially identified in the developing placenta both in the mouse and human as a serine protease associated with pregnancy [5]–[8]. HtrA3 is now known to inhibit trophoblast invasion during placental development [9], [10], and regulate ovarian development, granulosa cell differentiation and luteinisation [11], [12]. Studies in mice have also suggested that HtrA3 inhibits TGF-β signalling during embryo development [13].HtrA3 has two isoforms [long (HtrA3-L) and short (HtrA3-S)] resulting from alternative mRNA splicing [5], [6] (Figure 1). Full length human HtrA3-L and HtrA3-S contain 453 amino acids (aa) and 357 aa respectively. Both isoforms contain an N-terminal insulin-like growth factor binding (IGFB) domain and a Kazal protease-inhibitor domain followed by a signature trypsin-like serine protease domain. The HtrA3-L isoform differs from HtrA3-S with the presence of a C-terminal PDZ (post-synaptic density 95, Drosophila discs large, zona-occludens 1) domain (Figure 1) [5], [6]. HtrA3-S thus presents a naturally occurring HtrA lacking the C-terminal PDZ domain. Together, the N-terminal IGFB and Kazal domains in HtrA3 form a region homologous to Mac25, a follistatin-like protein with activin binding properties [14] (Figure 1). HtrA3 proteins undergo auto-cleavage. Protease dependent auto-catalytic cleavage of the Mac25 region from HtrA3 enhances protease activity and is necessary for mitochondrial to cytoplasmic translocation of HtrA3 and increased cell death [13], [15].

          The domain structures of human HtrA3-L and HtrA3-S proteins and their putative cleaved products HtrA3-L/C and HtrA3-S/C are shown. The Mac25 region is indicated. The solid bars below the protein domains denote the epitope location of each mAb, the four mAbs 6G6, 9C9, 10H10 and 3E6 were raised against HtrA3-L-S305A protein, and 2C4 was raised against a synthetic peptide.

      The HtrA3 protein shares 95% similarity between mice and humans [5], [6], and is expressed more abundantly in the heart, ovary, testis and placenta than in other tissues in the mouse [6]. While HtrA3-L is the predominant isoform expressed in the mouse [6], both HtrA3-L and HtrA3-S are expressed in human tissues, especially in the placenta [7]. It is unknown whether HtrA3-L and HtrA3-S are biochemically distinct, but the PDZ domain in HtrA3-L is predicted to regulate substrate specificity and possibly cellular localisation [5].Dysregulation of HtrA3 is associated with the development of a number of diseases including cancer and preeclampsia [15]–[22]. HtrA3 is downregulated in lung cancers through smoking-induced DNA methylation and this downregulation increases cancer cell longevity [16]. HtrA3 downregulation in lung cancer also contributes to resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments such as etoposide and cisplatin [15].HtrA3 is reported to inhibit TGF-β signalling in the endometrium [20], and is suggested to be involved in ovarian cell homeostasis and tumourigenesis [19]. Downregulation of HtrA3 is associated with the progression of endometrial and ovarian cancer [17]–[19]. HtrA3 is thus proposed to be a tumour suppressor and a potential therapeutic aid in cancer treatment [3], [15].In contrast, sustained expression of HtrA3 in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with the development of preeclampsia [22], [23]. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific multisystemic disorder primarily involving hypertension and proteinuria. Preeclampsia occurs in 2–10% of pregnancies worldwide [24], and is responsible for 14% of pregnancy related mortalities [25]. Women in developing countries with reduced access to medical treatment in particular, face a higher incidence (up to 16.7%) of preeclampsia-related morbidity and mortality compared to those in developed countries [24].Preeclampsia occurs after 20 weeks of gestation in previously normotensive women. Abnormal first trimester placentation generates a high state of maternal inflammation, preceding the onset of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia often restricts blood flow to the foetus causing intrauterine growth restriction. As symptoms of preeclampsia only resolve once the placenta is removed, the present “cure” for preeclampsia is delivery of the baby and the placenta, sometimes prematurely. Aside from complications resulting from premature birth, babies born from a preeclamptic pregnancy have a higher risk of developing chronic diseases (endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, as well as stroke and hypertension) in adulthood [26], [27]. Women who have had a preeclamptic pregnancy also have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease later in life [28].Early diagnosis of preeclampsia is critical for timely clinical intervention and supportive management of pregnant mothers and their foetuses. However, to date there is no clinically useful biochemical diagnostic assay that can predict preeclampsia in early pregnancy. As persistently high serum levels of HtrA3 are detected at the end of the first trimester in pregnant women who subsequently develop preeclampsia [22], we have proposed that monitoring HtrA3 in maternal blood during early pregnancy would identify women at risk for preeclampsia.In this study we describe the development and characterisation of a panel of highly specific HtrA3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). These mAbs were epitope-mapped and tested for a range of applications including western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Importantly, the mAbs were used to develop highly sensitive and high-throughput Amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay-linked immunosorbent assays (AlphaLISAs), based on luminescent oxygen channelling immunoassay technology, to detect HtrA3 in human serum. After being validated on recombinant HtrA3 proteins, the optimised assays were applied to first trimester serum samples collected from women who subsequently developed preeclampsia later in pregnancy. Significantly higher levels of HtrA3 were detected in preeclamptic cases compared to gestational-age matched controls, consistent with previous reports. This result demonstrates the critical importance of these HtrA3 mAbs and the newly developed HtrA3 serum detection assays for the diagnosis of preeclampsia and other diseases associated with HtrA3 dysregulation.
