Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are among the leading causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity worldwide, and include pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia [1], [2]. PIH and preeclampsia complicate about 7% of all pregnancies [3] and severe preeclampsia is a major cause of severe maternal morbidity (e.g. stroke and liver rupture) and adverse perinatal outcomes, such as prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction [4]. Risk factors for PIH and preeclampsia include family or obstetric history of preeclampsia, first pregnancy, obesity, higher maternal age, pre-existing diabetes, renal disease, hypertension, and chronic autoimmune disease [5]–[9]. Evidence for the influence of environmental and occupational factors is contradictory to a few studies that have suggested that these factors may play a role in the etiology of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy [10]. However, the underlying mechanisms for occupational risk factors, such as physically demanding work and exposure to chemicals, are unclear.Physically demanding work, such as prolonged standing and frequent lifting, may increase catecholamine levels [11]–[13] which may affect constriction/dilatation of blood vessels [14]. High levels of catecholemines have been demonstrated in patients suffering from preeclampsia [15]. Furthermore, increased catecholamine levels are hypothesized to decrease uterine blood flow and may therefore influence early placentation [12]. Contradictory findings have been reported on physically demanding work and occurrence of PIH or preeclampsia. Mozurkewich et al. showed in a meta-analysis, based on 4 studies, that physically demanding work was significantly associated with PIH and preeclampsia (OR 1.60, 95%CI 1.30–1.96) [16]. A more recent and larger review by Bonzini et al., based on 8 studies, concluded that for preeclampsia and PIH, although several positive findings were reported, the evidence base was too limited to allow firm conclusions. This second review excluded less articles than Mozurkewich et al., and included five more years of research, covering almost twice the number of articles. No meta-analysis could be performed, due to the large heterogeneity in exposure definitions, and the available evidence was not sufficient to justify mandatory restrictions on any of the occupational activities during pregnancy [17]. This latter review included some new studies that showed modest to no effect of several aspects of physically demanding work, such as working hours, standing, lifting, physical activity, and shift work on PIH and preeclampsia [18]–[23]. However, a recent study by Haelterman et al., which was not included in either review, showed that prolonged standing was associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia [24].Occupational exposure to chemicals in relation to hypertensive disorders during pregnancy has been rarely studied. Some studies on maternal exposure to chemicals have suggested that organic solvents [25] and pesticides [26] may increase the risk of hypertensive disorders. Based on these previous studies, we hypothesized that occupational risk factors, such as physically demanding work and exposure to chemicals, may influence the occurrence of PIH or preeclampsia. Since studies on occupational risk factors showed conflicting results, it is unclear how working pregnant women should be managed. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of occupational risk factors in the pathogenesis of PIH and preeclampsia, such that preventive measures, if needed, can be taken.The aim of this study was to assess, in a population-based prospective cohort study, the associations between physically demanding work and exposure to chemicals with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.
