A steady increase in incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been seen in the northern developed countries during the past decades [1]–[3] with a peaking incidence in the reproductive years [3]. Susceptibility to IBD has been found to be influenced by dietary and life style factors [2] as well as by genetics [4], and serum antibodies have been found to predict onset of IBD several years before onset of clinical symptoms [5]. Still, the mechanisms behind development of IBD are incompletely understood.Due to the higher incidence of IBD in reproductive years, the possible role of pregnancy in the aetiology of IBD is of interest, but most studies have investigated outcomes in patients with existing IBD [6], [7]. Self-rated pre-pregnancy health and pregnancy complications like hyperemesis, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia might be linked with risk of later disease development. Poor self-rated health (SRH) has been connected to systemic inflammatory changes [8]–[11], and mental disturbances like chronic stress, conceivably due to its association with poor SRH, has been suggested a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of IBD [12]. However, to our knowledge, associations of SRH, in general and in relation to pregnancy, with later development of IBD have not been investigated in a prospective observational study.In contrast, hyperemesis, a pregnancy complication characterised by nausea, vomiting, and weight loss initiated within 9 week's gestation [13], has previously been suggested to increase the risk of both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), whereas no such association has been observed for gestational hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia [14], despite the fact that preeclampsia, to a greater extent than hyperemesis, is followed by a cascade of systemic inflammatory responses [15] and circulatory disturbances [16], [17].On this background, the present study aimed to explore the possible influence of self-rated pre-pregnancy health, self-rated pregnancy course, hyperemesis, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia on risk of IBD using a large national cohort study.
