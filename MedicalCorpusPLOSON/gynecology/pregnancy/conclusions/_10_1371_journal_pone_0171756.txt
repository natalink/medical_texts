MicroRNAs belong to a family of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by degrading or blocking translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) targets [1, 2]. The diagnostic potential of specific molecular biomarkers and their implementation in predictive and diagnostic algorithms for pregnancy related complications are subjects of considerable interest [3].Although the study by Luque et al. [4] demonstrated that maternal serum microRNA assessment at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy did not appear to have any predictive value for early preeclampsia (requiring delivery before 34 weeks), the data from other studies strongly supported the need for a more detailed exploration of microRNAs in maternal circulation with the view toward routine assessment in everyday practice, and recognition that they represent potential biomarkers for pregnancy related complications [5–8].Our pilot study suggested the potential of using circulating C19MC microRNAs (miR-520h, miR-518b, miR-516b-5p, and miR-517-5p) to differentiate, at the beginning of gestation (weeks 10–13), between patients that will develop gestational hypertension and those that will have normal pregnancies [9]. First trimester screening of extracellular miR-520h alone or in combination with miR-518b was able to identify a significant proportion of women that went on to develop gestational hypertension [9].Recent studies of Ura et al. [5] have shown that severe preeclampsia is associated with alterations in extracellular microRNA expression (miR-1233, miR-520, miR-210 and miR-144) during the early stages of gestation (12–14 weeks).Latest preliminary studies by Winger et al. [6, 10] demonstrated that profiling of selected microRNA biomarkers in maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, prior the end of the first trimester, may successfully predict adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia and miscarriage. In addition, microRNA quantification of maternal blood cells was also able to predict the occurrence of late preeclampsia.As far as we know, this is the first study using first trimester screening of women at risk of developing preeclampsia or IUGR relative to circulating C19MC microRNAs (miR-516b-5p, miR-517-5p, miR-518b, miR-520a-5p, miR-520h, and miR-525-5p). Here, we discuss for the first time the effectiveness of circulating C19MC microRNAs as predictors of preeclampsia and IUGR. This study is a part of a long-term research program focused on the description of the complex pathogenesis mechanisms involved in pregnancy-related complications, with the goal of identifying of novel biomarkers that can diagnose and/or predict pregnancy-related complications [8, 9, 11].
