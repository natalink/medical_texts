Obstetric, perinatal and nephrologic care has improved since the first registered pregnancy in a kidney recipient in 1958 [1]. However, many questions still remain about how the pregnancy following kidney transplant affects the mother, child, and allograft.Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Even though the risk of preeclampsia is six times higher in kidney transplanted women compared to women without a transplant [2–4], there is little information about the direct association between preeclampsia and pregnancy outcomes in this group. For the mother and child, both preeclampsia and the need for preterm delivery have potential negative long-term health effects, including increased risks for later diseases like diabetes, adiposity and cardiovascular disease [5–7]. Preeclampsia is also associated with an increased risk for later end-stage renal disease [8] and may adversely affect the allograft and its function. In a previous study, we reported a high rate of chronic hypertension in Norwegian kidney transplanted women with preeclampsia [4]. Finding clinical characteristics that can lead to more accurate and early prediction of women at high risk of preeclampsia should be a first step in targeting prevention and follow-up. This may potentially decrease short and long-term complications.In this study, we investigated the effects of preeclampsia on pregnancy outcome and allograft function. We also examined maternal clinical characteristics in women with pregnancies following kidney transplantation using consistent diagnostic criteria. These data were used to identify prognostic factors that can be used to predict women at risk for preeclampsia in pregnancies following kidney transplantation.
