Preeclampsia is defined as the association of pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria of ≥300 mg/24 h after 20 weeks’ gestation [1] [2]. Preeclampsia is a common disease complicating 3% of pregnancies (4.1% in the first pregnancy and 1.7% in later ones) [3] and causing significant maternal and perinatal morbidity. A systematic review [4] highlighted that 10% to 15% of maternal deaths that occur every year worldwide are related to hypertensive complications of pregnancy. Preeclampsia is also a major cause of iatrogenic preterm delivery [2] [5]. Many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of prevention and several reviews have assessed different interventions such as antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) [6], calcium [7], antioxidants [8] or even garlic [9] or marine oil and other prostaglandin precursors [10]. The Cochrane Library contains several reviews dealing with prevention of preeclampsia.Risk factors of preeclampsia have been largely investigated. Duckitt et al., [11] in their systematic review, listed risk factors that included (in decreasing pooled relative-risk order) antiphospholipids antibodies, previous history of preeclampsia, pre-existing diabetes, multiple pregnancy, nulliparity, family history, increased blood pressure, increased body mass index, and maternal age. Nulliparity holds a special place for three reasons. First, with a relative risk of 2.91 [11] and a prevalence of 44.6% among pregnancies [12], the population attributable risk can be estimated at 46.0% [13]. Thus, almost half of the preeclampsia episodes may be due to nulliparity. In terms of public health, nulliparity is the most important risk factor of preeclampsia and raises issues of prevention [14]. Second, by definition, multiparous women have an obstetric history as compared with nulliparous women; thus, women with previous preeclampsia have a 14.7% risk of the condition in the second pregnancy [3]. Therefore, in terms of prevention, identifying women at risk of preeclampsia naturally differs between nulliparous and multiparous women [14]. Third, in terms of pathophysiology, serious arguments suggest that mechanisms of preeclampsia differ between nulliparous and multiparous women [2]. A systematic review of underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of preeclampsia highlighted differences in immunological responses, angiogenic factor profile or reactivity to insulin resistance between early pregnancies and later ones [15]. Such differences may explain baseline risk differences between nulliparous and multiparous women and may also lead to heterogeneous preventive treatment effect [16].Because of the specific place of the parity risk factor in preeclampsia, RCTs of prevention should be restricted to nulliparous or multiparous populations or at least be stratified by parity, [16] with ad hoc subgroup analyses. We aimed to assess whether such trials conform to this direction by undertaking a systematic review of published reports of RCTs and descriptions of registered trials [17]. We also aimed to illustrate how mixing these two populations in RCTs may impact both the nominal power of the trial and the interpretation of the results.
