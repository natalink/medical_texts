Monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin placentation occurs in one in every 400 pregnancies, and is characterised by placental vascular anastomoses and thus interfetal transfusion [1]. MCDA twins are considered high risk by virtue of their 3- to 5-fold increased perinatal morbidity and mortality compared to dichorionic (DC) twins. This is largely attributed to twin–twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which occurs in 15%–20% of MCDA twin pregnancies, and discordant intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which complicates an additional 25% [1–5]. Further, in the event of intrauterine death (IUD) of one twin, there is a 40%–50% risk of death or neurological damage in the co-twin from acute intertwin transfusion [6–8]. There is also a minor contribution to the risk of MCDA twin pregnancies from a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of structural anomalies, particularly congenital heart disease [9,10]. With the decline in perinatal mortality in singletons in recent decades, increasing attention is now being given to improving outcomes in high-risk multiple pregnancies.The rationale for heightened fetal surveillance in monochorionic (MC) compared to DC twins is early detection of TTTS and IUGR, to allow timely treatment in an attempt to prevent adverse perinatal outcome, principally by amnioreduction, endoscopic laser ablation of anastomoses, bipolar cord occlusion, or early delivery. Although the frequency of monitoring has not been evaluated in randomised trials for any type of twin pregnancy, it is common practice to monitor MC twins more frequently than DC twins. Despite a vigilant policy in our centre of fortnightly ultrasound surveillance for MCDA pregnancies, we observed that unexpected late fetal deaths still occurred in seemingly uncomplicated MCDA twins.We aimed to determine the prospective gestational age-specific risk of unexpected IUD in uncomplicated MCDA twins after viability (24 wk of gestation). We also investigated the cause of such deaths and whether they could be predicted antenatally.
