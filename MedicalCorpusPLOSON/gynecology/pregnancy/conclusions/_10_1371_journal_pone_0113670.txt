Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive complication of pregnancy that involves many organ systems, including the kidney, liver and brain [1]. Some of the most serious complications of PE involve neurologic symptoms and include uncontrolled vomiting, severe and persistent headache, visual disturbances, unexplained seizure (eclampsia), coma and death [1]. Eclampsia is a life-threatening condition with high maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality [2], [3]. The mechanism by which de novo seizure occurs in women with PE is not known, however, studies have shown that the brain is more excitable during pregnancy and PE, suggesting a lower seizure threshold that may contribute to de novo seizure. For example, network excitability in brain slices of pregnant mice was increased compared to virgin animals [4]. Further, a lower seizure threshold was reported in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat model of PE compared to normal pregnancy [5], suggesting pregnancy and PE may predispose the brain to seizure through increased neuronal excitability. However, the mechanism by which neuronal excitability is augmented in PE is unknown.One of the primary mechanisms by which neuronal excitability can increase is through activation of microglia and neuroinflammation [6], [7]. Microglial activation under conditions of peripheral inflammation has been shown to decrease seizure threshold via a promotional effect on neuronal excitability [8]. In addition, increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability can result in neuroinflammation by allowing passage of serum constituents into the brain that activate microglia [9]–[12]. A previous study showed that circulating factors present during normal pregnancy are hyperexcitable to the brain through activation of microglia, and increase network excitability in a hippocampal slice culture model [13]. In addition, circulating factors during PE have been shown to increase BBB permeability that could potentially pass into the maternal brain to promote neuroinflammation and decrease seizure threshold [14], [15]. In the present study, we hypothesized that PE produces a state of neuroinflammation that lowers seizure threshold. We further hypothesized that BBB disruption during PE leads to microglia activation and is a mechanism by which seizure threshold is lowered during PE.Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is currently the most effective and commonly administered drug for eclamptic seizure prophylaxis and reduces the incidence of eclampsia by ∼50% [16]–[20]. MgSO4 is administered to women at relatively high doses to raise serum levels to between 4.2–8.4 mg/dL over 12–24 hours [16]. However, despite its apparent effectiveness, dangerous side effects are associated with MgSO4 use, including the potential for areflexia, respiratory paralysis and cardiac arrest [16]. Further, although it is the preferred treatment strategy in women with PE, the exact mechanism by which MgSO4 prevents eclampsia is not clear and may be multifaceted. Animal studies have provided evidence that MgSO4 has protective actions at the BBB, lowering permeability during acute hypertension, and reducing hyperosmolar-induced disruption of the BBB [21], [22]. We hypothesized that MgSO4 treatment during PE increases seizure threshold by preserving the integrity of the BBB and preventing microglial activation, thereby decreasing neuroinflammation.In the present study, we developed a rat model of severe PE that incorporated placental ischemia and maternal endothelial dysfunction that are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of PE [23]. In particular, we sought to model severe PE that encompasses both fetal and maternal symptoms and has the greatest risk of life-threatening complications [23], [24]. This model used the reduced uteroplacental perfusion pressure (RUPP) model of placental ischemia [25] combined with a high cholesterol diet previously shown to cause maternal endothelial dysfunction [15], [26]. Using this model, we investigated the effect of severe PE on seizure threshold, BBB permeability in vivo and neuroinflammation. Further, rats with severe PE were treated with a clinically relevant dose of MgSO4 for 24 hours, and the effect of MgSO4 on these parameters was also determined.
