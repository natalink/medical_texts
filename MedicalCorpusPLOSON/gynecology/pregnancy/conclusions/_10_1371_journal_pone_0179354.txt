In summary, we found that preeclampsia/eclampsia was associated with some maternal characteristics, such as maternal age, education, marital status, parity, excessive weight gain, and body mass index at the first antenatal visit. Our study demonstrates that maternal smoking was inversely associated with preeclampsia/eclampsia. Moreover, increased number of daily smoked cigarettes during pregnancy decreased odds of preeclampsia/eclampsia. Interesting, if women quit smoking during pregnancy they had the same risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia as those who smoked while pregnant. Even though our findings imply that giving up smoking does not alter the reduced risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia, it would most likely mitigate known smoking-related risks to the mother and the unborn. This advice might be shared during the first antenatal visit.
