Preterm birth is the main cause of neonatal mortality and short- and long-term morbidity. Neonatal mortality and morbidity are inversely correlated with gestational age at delivery, with the majority of those adverse outcomes associated with early preterm birth (i.e., delivery before 32 wk gestation) [1]. As a consequence, societal costs of preterm births in the US exceed US$26 billion a year [1].Unfortunately there are no effective methods of prevention or treatment of preterm birth. The most promising intervention—progesterone supplementation—to date has been shown to be effective only in a small subset of women at risk for preterm birth [2],[3]: in women with prior preterm birth or with a short cervix (≤15 mm), constituting respectively 3.3% and 1.7% of pregnancies at risk [4],[5].Several studies demonstrated an association between lower concentrations of folate and shorter duration of pregnancy. Observational studies have showed that women delivering preterm have lower concentrations of folate in plasma or red blood cells [6]–[9]. Results of interventional trials of folate supplementation during pregnancy are less conclusive. Supplementation of folate during pregnancy resulted in longer duration of pregnancy in some [10],[11] but not in all studies [12]–[14].However, a growing body of evidence of human studies and animal models suggests that duration of pregnancy may be the ultimate consequence of conditions in the very earliest stages of pregnancy or before conception [15]–[17]. We tested the hypothesis that preconceptional folate supplementation is associated with reduction in the risk of spontaneous preterm birth.
