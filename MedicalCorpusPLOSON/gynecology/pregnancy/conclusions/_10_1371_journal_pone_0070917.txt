Approximately 50% of non-anomalous stillborn infants are small for gestational age (SGA) and survivors are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay, cerebral palsy [1] and later cardiovascular complications and diabetes [2]. Traditionally, SGA has been defined using population-based birthweight centiles but utilization of customized centiles has enabled identification of additional small babies at higher risk of morbidity and mortality [3], [4].In routine antenatal care, less than a quarter of all SGA babies are identified before birth [5]. SGA infants who are recognized and well managed before birth have been reported to have a four-fold reduction in perinatal death and severe fetal distress [6]. Utilization of customized antenatal growth charts in routine antenatal care has been associated with improvements in antenatal identification of SGA infants with detection rates of up to 50% [5], [7] but there remains a need for early pregnancy tools which would further increase the level of detection. Development of a reliable early pregnancy risk prediction algorithm enabling identification, monitoring and timely delivery of SGA infants has the potential to reduce both morbidity and mortality in these vulnerable infants. SGA infants can be broadly classified into two main categories with distinct maternal phenotypes: SGA with a normotensive mother (Normotensive-SGA) and SGA where the mother has gestational hypertension, preeclampsia or chronic hypertension (Hypertensive-SGA). We have previously reported that Normotensive- SGA comprises approximately three quarters of all SGA infants born to nulliparous women and that risk factors for Normotensive-SGA and Hypertensive-SGA differ, suggesting that they could be considered as distinct conditions from the perspective of prediction [8].Our primary aim was to develop clinical risk prediction models for All-SGA, Normotensive-SGA and Hypertensive-SGA infants using clinical data obtained at 15 weeksâ€™ gestation and to determine whether addition of fetal measurements and uterine and umbilical artery Doppler data from the 20 week ultrasound scan improved prediction based on clinical risk alone.
