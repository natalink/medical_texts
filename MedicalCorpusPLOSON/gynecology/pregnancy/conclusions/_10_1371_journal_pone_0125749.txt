A CBA for quality of care provided to women with severe hypertensive disorders in pregnancy is a process based on local guidelines and contexts. Substandard adherence to a number of protocols can be identified and point towards opportunities for targeted improvement strategies. The CBA is an effective tool to determine quality of care, identify gaps in standard of care, and allow for monitoring and evaluation in a health facility, ultimately resulting in improved quality of care provided and reduced maternal morbidity and mortality.
