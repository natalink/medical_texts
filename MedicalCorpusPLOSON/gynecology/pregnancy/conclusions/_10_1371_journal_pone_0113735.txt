Since the placenta is being continuously remodelled during normal placental development, extracellular nucleic acids of both fetal and placental origin, packed into either trophoblast-derived apoptotic bodies or shedding syncytiotrophoblast microparticles, may be detected in maternal circulation during the course of normal gestation [1]–[5]. Latest findings revealed that microRNAs are also packed within exosomal nanoparticles released into the blood and extracellular compartment mediating the communication between diverse types of neighbouring or distant cells [6]–[9].There has been a trend over the last 10 years to develop non-invasive methods utilizing quantification of cell-free nucleic acids inclusive of microRNAs in maternal circulation [5], [10]–[29]. The diagnostic potential of particular molecular biomarkers and their implementation in the current predictive and diagnostic algorithms for pregnancy related complications are subject of interest [5].MicroRNAs belong to a family of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by degrading or blocking translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) targets [30], [31].Recent studies have shown that clinically established preeclampsia is associated with alterations in extracellular microRNA expression [32]–[35]. Nevertheless, no differentiation between pregnancies with normal and fetal growth-restricted foetuses was observed when circulating microRNA expression levels were compared [36]–[38]. Nevertheless, the recent study of Whitehead et al. revealed up-regulation of several hypoxia-regulated microRNAs in pregnancies complicated by severe preterm fetal growth restriction compared to gestation-matched controls [39].However, most of investigators focused on the study of those microRNAs, whose genes are located outside chromosome 19 miRNA clusters (C19MC and miR-371-3 cluster) or the chromosome 14 miRNA cluster (C14MC) that encode pregnancy-associated microRNAs [40]–[44].We have previously identified C19MC microRNAs (miR-516-5p, miR-517*, miR-518b, miR-520a*, miR-520h, miR-525 and miR-526a) present in maternal plasma differentiating between normal pregnancies and non-pregnant individuals [45]. Significant increases in extracellular C19MC microRNAs levels (miR-516-5p, miR-517*, miR-518b, miR-520a*, miR-520h, miR-525 and miR-526a) over time in normally progressing pregnancies were observed [45], [46].The results of our follow-up study indicated that the up-regulation of miR-516-5p, miR-517*, miR-520a*, miR-525 and miR-526a is a characteristic phenomenon of established preeclampsia [47].The data resulting from our pilot study suggested the potential of extracellular C19MC microRNAs to differentiate, at the beginning of gestation (within 12th to 16th weeks), between patients at risk of later development of placental insufficiency related complications and normal pregnancies [46]. These data strongly supported the need for a more detailed exploration of extracellular microRNAs in maternal circulation with the view toward routine assessment into everyday practice, and recognition as potential biomarkers for placental insufficiency related pregnancy complications.To our knowledge, no prospective study of women enrolled at first trimester screening to describe the profile of circulating C19MC microRNAs in the women at risk of subsequently developing gestational hypertension has been carried out. Here, we discuss for the first time the effectiveness of circulating C19MC microRNAs to predict the later occurrence of gestational hypertension.Consequently, the function and functional relationship analysis of predicted targets of aberrantly expressed C19MC microRNAs in patients destined to develop gestational hypertension, was performed.
