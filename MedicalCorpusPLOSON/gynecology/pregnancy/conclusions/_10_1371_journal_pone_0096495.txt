We found an increased risk of venous thromboembolism after activation of the inflammatory system, which we assessed by examining filled prescriptions for antibiotics and additionally based on hospitalization discharge diagnoses that indicated infection. We also found that hospitalization itself is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, especially when the causes for admission were preeclampsia, bleeding episode and also intrauterine growth restriction or intrauterine fetal death. We confirmed that maternal age, hyperemesis, multiple pregnancies, obesity, and caesarean section are important risk factors for venous thromboembolism during pregnancy or the puerperal period.
