Preeclampsia is associated with significant pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality, [1]. The etiology of preeclampsia is still not well understood, but several risk factors have been identified. These include genetic factors [2], [3], nulliparity, multifetal gestations, maternal race and age, and pre-existing conditions such as preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy, chronic hypertension, kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity [1].Numerous studies have documented an inverse association between cigarette smoking during pregnancy and preeclampsia in different populations with a reduction of risk by up to 50% [4]. The underlying mechanism for this association is still not well understood with several hypothesized pathways, including carbon monoxide-mediated inhibition of inflammation [5], enhanced vasodilation [6], suppression of platelet aggregation [7], plasminogen activation [7], apoptosis [8], [9], reactive oxygen species formation [10], and sFlt-1, an antiangiogenic factor [11], [12].Advanced maternal age and race/ethnicity have been well documented to be significant risk factors for a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Gregory and Korst observed that older pregnant women experienced increased risk of a number of maternal, fetal, and placental conditions including hypertension [13]. Rates of hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia appear to vary by race and ethnicity, as do the presentation and course of the disease [13]–[23]. In the U.S., preeclampsia risk is higher in ethnic minority women compared with non-Hispanic white women, with African-American women having the highest rate [18], [22], [23]. The causal mechanisms explaining the racial and ethnic differences in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are largely unknown. These disparities might be related to a number of risk factors that are associated with race and ethnicity for preeclampsia, including chronic hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease [24]. For instance, it has been shown that white women are more likely to smoke heavily during pregnancy (≥20 cigarette daily) than women of other race and ethnicity [23], [25].Despite the acknowledged disparity in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy by maternal age and race/ethnicity, few prior studies have examined the impact of their joint interactive effect with other known risk factors. The objective of this study was to examine the association between cigarette use during pregnancy and PIH by maternal race/ethnicity and age.
