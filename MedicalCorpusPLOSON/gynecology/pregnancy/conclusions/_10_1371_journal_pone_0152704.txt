This study adds further evidence for the dominant cardiac sympathetic modulations in patients with preeclampsia compared with normal pregnant women, probably due to parasympathetic withdrawal in the first group. However, the higher LnVLF and LnLF readings achieved by preeclampsia pregnant women compared with the controls are unexpected in the view that augmented sympathetic modulations usually depresses all HRV parameters including these two measures. Explanation of this contradiction remains to be uncovered by further researches.
