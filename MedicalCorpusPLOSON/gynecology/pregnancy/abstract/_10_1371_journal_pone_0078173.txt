Background: Emerging evidence showed that VEGF gene polymorphisms are involved in the regulation of VEGF protein expression, thus increasing an individual's susceptibility to preeclampsia (PE); but individually published results are inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the associations between VEGF gene polymorphisms and PE risk. Methods: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure) databases was conducted. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 12.0 software and Review manager 5.1. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. Results: According to the inclusion criteria, 11 case-control studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. A total of 1,069 PE cases and 1,315 controls were included in this study. Our meta-analysis indicated that VEGF +936C/T (T vs. C, OR = 1.52, 95%CI = 1.08–2.12) or −634G/C polymorphism (C vs. G, OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.03–1.50) was associated with the risk of PE, whereas there was no association between −2578C/A (A vs. C, OR = 0.98, 95%CI = 0.82–1.16) or −1154G/A (A vs. G, OR = 1.30, 95%CI = 0.94–1.78) polymorphism and PE risk in our study. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggested that VEGF −2578C/A or −1154G/A polymorphism had no association with PE risk in all examined patients, whereas there was an association between VEGF +936C/T or −634G/C polymorphism and risk of PE.
