In conclusion, association of X-chromosome microdeletions at Xq27.3 and Xq28 with male infertility could not be confirmed nor excluded for Czech males. The data suggest a possibility that the detected microdeletions Xcnv64 and Xcnv69 might be associated with lower semen quality within the normal range. However, these microdeletions do not seem to confer a significant risk of impaired spermatogenesis in the Czech population. The potential clinical role of the previously reported patient-specific Xcnv67 remains to be determined in a larger study population.
