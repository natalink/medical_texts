Our study results suggest that an adequate number and content of prenatal care visits reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with infertility, especially the risk of a VLBW birth. This population-based study revealed no significant association between female-caused infertility and congenital malformations. Our findings reemphasize the important role of adequate prenatal care in favorable pregnancy outcomes. It should be stressed that frequent and timely prenatal care, which provides important screening, testing, and monitoring services, has the potential to reduce the risks of adverse birth outcomes, especially among high-risk pregnancies of women with a history of infertility.Further investigation of the quantity and quality of prenatal care is suggested in order to improve the effectiveness of prenatal care for high-risk pregnancies. Additional research is needed to differentiate the effects of prenatal visits on birth outcomes among treated and untreated women with an infertility diagnosis, and examine the association between paternal infertility and pregnancy outcomes.
