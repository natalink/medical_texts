A positive history of syphilis infection can reduce the clinical pregnancy rate following IVF/ICSI. We have shown that this reduction in the clinical pregnancy rate involves a variety of factors, including endometrial thickness, the number of mature oocytes, the number of fertilized, normally cleaved oocytes, and the implantation rate. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of syphilis on IVF success are currently unclear. Future studies should use larger sample sizes to better elucidate these mechanisms.
