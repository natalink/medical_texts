We found that the risk of smaller newborn size was higher in ART singletons from fresh embryos transfer and lower in ART singletons from cryopreserved embryos transfer compared with non-ART singleton infants. Although statistically significant, the magnitude of excess risk among ART singletons from fresh embryos transfer was small, which is reassuring. Similarly, the excess risk of smaller newborn size within ART subgroups defined by infertility source (male, female), was not large. Greater subgroup heterogeneity in newborn size may be detected if assessed by underlying infertility causes and ART therapy subtypes; our future work will investigate this potential heterogeneity.
