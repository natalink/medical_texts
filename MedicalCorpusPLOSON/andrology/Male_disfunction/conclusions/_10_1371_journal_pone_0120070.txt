This study does not indicate adverse effects of phthalates on couple fecundity. The reason for the observed shorter TTP in women with high levels of DEHP metabolites is unknown, but the suggested association between DEHP exposure and lifestyles associated to TTP and the anti-androgenic effect of the phthalates should be investigated in future studies.
