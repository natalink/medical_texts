This study explored the experiences of Chinese couples undergoing IVF treatment, especially their perception of the process and the support between couples. The four themes that were identified were: the process of hardship, the endurance of hardship with a loving relationship, partnership in couples, and ambivalence towards social support. The findings offer insights into the sufferings of IVF couples and point to the need for a supportive program for infertile couples as dyads to help them get through the hardships of treatment. The findings also provide empirical contributions on the right timing, focus, format, and outcome measures of a tailored program. It is also suggested that policy makers mandate the incorporation of psychological counseling or intervention into infertility treatment. It is hoped that supportive interventions will enhance the partnership of infertile couples undergoing IVF treatment and their flexibility on the issue of bearing a child, resulting in improvements to their psychological well-being and marital relationship.
