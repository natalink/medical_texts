Our study supports previously reported inverse associations between testicular cancer and number of children and sibship size. However, our findings did not reveal an association between duration of attempt to conceive or use of assisted reproduction techniques and subsequent incidence of testicular cancer. The role of infertility, and the involved mechanisms, in testicular carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated.
