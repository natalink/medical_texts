As 60% of men without risk factors still presented a semen volume less than 2 mL on their next semen analysis, we suggest to systematically associate a PEU with the next semen analysis after a first one presenting LSV, to confirm LSV as a constant feature and to assess the presence of partial retrograde ejaculation (PRE). PRE diagnosis requires expressing sperm in postejaculatory urine (PEU) as an R-ratio as previously defined; we suggest an R-value higher than the range of [7.1–8.3]% as indicative of PRE until the results of a prospective multicenter study to be run. If there is no PRE, a TRUS is recommended to look for absence/obstruction of a seminal vesicle either isolated or associated with an absent vas deferens, whatever the sperm count.Diagnosing PRE in men with LSV in absence of any known risk factors has potential implications in male and couple infertility. Clinical value of diagnosing PRE may allow explaining low reproductive ability in patients who do not ejaculate part of sperm leading to reducing chance of natural pregnancy. Besides, using the PEU sperm fraction in cases of LSV associated with oligozoospermia may allow moving from IVF/ICSI to intra-uterine insemination for some couples.Knowledge value of PRE diagnosis is to decipher two subpopulations in infertile men with LSV without any risk factors for LSV or PRE. First, a specific subpopulation in which a potential dyssynergic ejaculation could exist; identifying such a population may lead further to use specific treatment to improve patients’ reproductive chances. Second, a subpopulation in which LSV without PRE is associated with impaired spermatogenesis indicating search for either a common hormonal factor or partial obstructive causes of the excurrent ducts. Taking into account the low prevalence among infertile men of LSV without any risk factors for LSV or PRE further multicentre prospective studies are required.
