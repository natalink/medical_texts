In summary, our meta-analysis suggested that the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism is associated with an enhanced risk of male infertility, supporting the hypothesis that the MTHFR 677C>T may be a potential cause of male infertility. Specifically, increased infertility risks with MTHFR 677C>T were observed in overall analysis and most subgroups, except oligo subgroup. However, large scale, well-designed and high quality epidemiological studies will be required to confirm our findings in the future.
