A high leukocyte count in prostate-specific materials (EPS, post-M), even in the absence of clear leukocytopsermia, is an important source of seminal and systemic OxS that may be associated with male infertility.

In addition, there is an urgent need for studies on the effects of chronic inflammatory diseases of the prostate on the general health of men.
