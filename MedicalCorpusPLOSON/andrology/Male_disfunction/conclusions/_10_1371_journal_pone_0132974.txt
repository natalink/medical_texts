In conclusion, we found slightly alkaline conditions seem to stimulate human sperm motility and capacitation. The dramatically decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activity caused by acidic environment could be the reason of lower sperm motility and Ca2+ level, which ultimately affected pregnancy. However, the mechanisms of pH affecting Na+/K+-ATPase activity in human spermatozoa are not completely elucidated. In addition to affecting Na+/K+-ATPase, acidic environment may be able to damage the sperm cell membrane directly, or to increase the active oxygen content, thus affecting sperm motility and capacitation, which warrant further explorations.
