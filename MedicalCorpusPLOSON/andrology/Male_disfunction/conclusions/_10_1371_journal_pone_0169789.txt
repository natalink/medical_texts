In summary, this meta-analysis provides evidence that the MTHFR C667T polymorphism may contribute to genetic susceptibility to the risk of male infertility in the Chinese population, whereas MTHFR A1298C and MS A2576G polymorphisms may have no impact. Nevertheless, large-scale, well-designed and population-based studies are needed to investigate the combined effects of these variants within the MTHFR gene or other folate-related enzyme genes in the Chinese population, which may lead to a comprehensive understanding of their potential roles in infertility.
