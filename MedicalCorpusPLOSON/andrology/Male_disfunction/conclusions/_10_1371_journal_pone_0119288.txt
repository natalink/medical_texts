Tests carried out in field cages in La RÃ©union Island confirm the stability of sterilizing performances of LR[wPip(Is)] males and evidenced a good competitiveness of LR[wPip(Is)] males compared to wild type males. In addition, crossing experiments confirm the coexistence of distinct CI phenotypes on several natural populations on the island, with limited but still not negligible expression of unidirectional CI. These data should be considered in future inundative releases as accidental releases of LR[wPip(Is)] females without a proper monitoring of Wolbachia dynamics in natural populations might compromise the success of IIT.
