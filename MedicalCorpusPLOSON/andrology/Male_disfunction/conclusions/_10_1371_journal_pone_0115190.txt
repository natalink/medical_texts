In summary, the findings demonstrate that, in Chinese population studied, four polymorphisms of NOS genes, namely, NOS1 rs2682826, NOS1 rs1047735, NOS2 rs2297518, and NOS2 rs10459953 were not correlated with male infertility. But we showed that NOS3 rs1799983 was significantly associated with risk of male infertility and sperm DNA damage. Our founding might be helpful in improving our understanding of the genetic susceptibility of sperm DNA integrity and in providing diagnostic implications for assisted reproduction success rates. Future large-scale studies with ethnically diverse populations and functional evaluations are needed to validate our findings.
