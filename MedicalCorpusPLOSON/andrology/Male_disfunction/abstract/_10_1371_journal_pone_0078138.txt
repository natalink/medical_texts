Background: Follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) is a glycoprotein and widely used for the treatment of infertility; FSH action is mediated by FSH receptor (FSHR), SNPs of which determine the ovarian response. Two polymorphisms of the FSHR gene were identified, which caused a change of threonine (T) to alanine (A) at position 307 and asparagine (N) to serine(S) at position 680. Both polymorphic sites give rise to three discrete variants of the FSHR: TT, TA, and AA for position 307; NN, NS, and SS for position 680. Methodology/Principal Findings: 450 Chinese women were recruited in an assisted reproductive technology program from October 2011 to March 2012. FSHR polymorphisms at the positions 307 and 680 were examined by PCR-RFLP. Serum FSH and estradiol level, FSH amount, ovarian response and pregnancy rate were recorded during treatment. The basal FSH levels were higher in AA [7.38 ± 2.07 vs 6.34 ± 1.75, 6.63 ± 1.94, P<0.05, 95% CI (6.75, 8.01)] and SS [7.51 ± 2.01 vs 6.31 ± 1.75, 6.66 ± 1.96, P<0.05, 95% CI (6.88, 8.15)] compared to other genotypes respectively; the days for ovulation induction was slightly longer in AA and SS. Women with AA and SS have higher rates of poor response compared to carriers of other genotypes (P<0.05). Furthermore, there is a nearly complete linkage between these two polymorphisms in Chinese women (D’=0.95, r2=0.84). Conclusions/Significance: In Chinese women receiving ART, the subjects with AA and SS genotypes have higher basal FSH levels, and these genotypes are associated with an increased risk of poor response. Our data suggested that the personalized FSH therapy may be applied according to patient’s genetic background in clinical settings. The linkage suggested that the polymorphisms of Thr307Ala and Asn680Ser may be used as TAG-SNP markers for analysis of potential genotyping in ART.
