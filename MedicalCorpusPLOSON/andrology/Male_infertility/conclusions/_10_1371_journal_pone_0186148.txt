There is a difference in lumbar spinal canal size between operated lumbar herniated disc patients with CES and lumbar herniated disc patient without CES (operated because of sciatica). No other MRI characteristics as predictors for presentation or outcome of CES are identified. This finding might imply that sciatica patients with a relative small spinal canal might need to be approached differently in managing complaints of herniated disc, to prevent progression to CES. This hypothesis has to be tested in future studies. Since the current study was retrospective and the number of studied patients relatively small, further prospective research should be conducted before clinical consequences and guideline changes are considered.
