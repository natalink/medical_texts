Finasteride is a synthetic 4-azasteroid molecule, used in the treatment of both androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [1]. Finasteride impedes the in loco conversion of testosterone (T) into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by inhibiting the 5-α-reductase (5-α-R) enzyme, primarily the 5-α-R type 2, in tissues and liver [1]–[3]. In adults, DHT is known to act as primary androgen in prostate and hair follicles [1], [2], [4].Androgens, in association with genetic factors, have been involved in AGA pathogenesis [5], [6]. Circulating and local androgen hormones are considered a necessary (although not sufficient) condition for the development of AGA. T and DHT were demonstrated to induce apoptosis in dermal papilla cells (DPC) in a dose-dependent and time-related manner [7]. In the majority of men with male pattern baldness endogenous production of DHT is markedly increased, providing a rationale for therapeutic 5 alpha-reductase inhibition in this disorder [8].The molecular action of androgens is mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), a member of steroid hormone receptors family [9], [10]. Testosterone or DHT binds to AR present in the cell cytoplasm, the ligand binding activates the receptor to translocate into the nucleus, homodimerize, and act as a transcription factor binding specific DNA response elements called AREs (androgen response elements) present in different target genes to mostly up-regulate gene expression [4]. Thus, AR is responsible for androgens physiological effects through activation of specific androgen responsive genes [11]. Presently, it is questioned whether blocking of T conversion to DHT by finasteride in prostate tissue will change expression of AR [12].According to the recent Mella and colleagues meta-analysis [13], there is moderate quality evidence that inhibition of DHT synthesis by finasteride (usually at a dosage of 1 mg/day) is able to prevent AGA progression and to increase hair density and quality in male patients [13]. The main limit of finasteride use against AGA is the onset of side effects [14]. More common adverse side effects are: erectile dysfunction, loss of libido and ejaculation disorders [13], [15]. Less common side effects include anxiety, depression, gynecomastia, and breast cancer in men [16]. Of concern, recently, it has been reported that adverse side effects of finasteride used to treat AGA might be persistent several months or years after finasteride discontinuation [14], [17]–[19]. The actual incidence of this phenomenon is still to be determined, but such negative events impairing sexual health in young males causes a severe loss in terms of life quality [14], [17]. In year 2011 a study by Irwig and Kolukula [18] first characterized the types and duration of persistent sexual side effects that occurred in 71 otherwise healthy men during or immediately after taking finasteride for the treatment of AGA. Most men developed sexual dysfunction in multiple domains with 94% experiencing low libido, 92% experiencing erectile dysfunction, 92% experiencing decreased arousal, and 69% experiencing problems with orgasm [18].Since June 2010 the pharmaceutical company (Merck) that produces Propecia (finasteride 1 mg/day for AGA treatment) included in the drug sheet as rare but possible side effects erection disorders persistent after drug discontinuation, and infertility. In April 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration required to expand the list of persistent sexual adverse events indicated in the labels for Propecia [16]. Of interest, many patients with long-term adverse effects refer of skin discomfort in genital area; severity of this effect in some cases is even described as a local paresthesia. The origin of these phenomena is not known.In the present study, we investigated the reasons of reduced or altered sensitivity localized in the genital area in 8 men who took finasteride to treat AGA and who also suffered from sexual dysfunction including discomfort, numbness or even paresthesia of the skin in the genital area, persistent loss of libido and erectile dysfunction over 6 months after discontinuing finasteride treatment. To assess the sensitivity issue we collected foreskin samples from all case patients to determine nerve density and we compared the results with similar samples from 11 age-matched healthy finasteride untreated controls that underwent circumcision to treat phimosis. We also compared the AR tissue expression between the 2 groups and explored the relation between AR and the symptoms showed by the case patients.
