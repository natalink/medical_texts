Decreased sexual activity and function is very common in patients with cardiovascular disease [1, 2]. Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for sexual dysfunction, and around 30% of hypertension patients complain of erectile dysfunction [3]. So blood pressure (BP) control might be useful to decrease the risk of erectile dysfunction [4–6]. Indeed, recently, a clinical study reports that BP control by β-blockers is associated with the lower prevalence of sexual dysfunction, independent of age, cardiovascular disease, and medical treatments and that beneficial effect of BP control is greater in older patients.4 Although some data showed that angiotensin Ⅱ antagonists might be beneficial for erectile function and sexual activity [5, 6], there are no good direct data to recommend a specific class of cardiovascular drug to improve sexual function in patients with cardiovascular disease [1]. On the contrary, many antihypertensive drugs, such as diuretics, some classical β-blockers and centrally acting sympatholytic drugs have been implicated in causing sexual dysfunction [7, 8]. Moreover, in medical practice, physicians frequently attribute sexual problems to the antihypertensive drug and modify or discontinue medication regimens. The side effect of antihypertensive hypertensive drugs might destroy the benefit of BP control on sexual function. So both BP control and the side effect of different antihypertensive drugs should be considered to improve the patients’ adherence.In this article, we used male SHR, to compare the effects of 5 antihypertensive drugs (representing 5 classes of antihypertensive agents), at doses that achieved similar BP control.
