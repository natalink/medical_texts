We found that both female and male sexual function as well as maternal depressive symptoms did not differ 6 months after childbirth among women who had experienced midpelvic and low pelvic aOVD. These findings at 6 months should help clinician to inform women and their partners about what to expect after a midpelvic aOVD. The data at 6 months postpartum are reassuring and need further studies at long-term to confirm these short-term data.
