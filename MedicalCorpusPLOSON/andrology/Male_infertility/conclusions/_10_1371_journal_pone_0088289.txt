The association between sexual dysfunction and use of opioids has been described extensively [1]–[3]. Previous studies found that sexual desire was enhanced among drug users during the initial six months after starting drug use. However, heroin users reported gradually decreasing and disappearing sexual interest. Palha and Esteves found that 72% of men and 65% of women who used heroin for more than six months reported decreasing satisfaction with their sexual behavior [4].Using methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) to treat opioid dependence began in the United States in 1964, and it has been shown to be an effective intervention in controlling drug use among heroin addicts [5], [6]. Positive effects of methadone maintenance include reduced frequency of opioid use[7], reduced frequency of criminal behavior [8], reduced HIV transmission [9], mortality reduction [10], and improved employment status [11].Numerous previous studies have reported varying prevalence of sexual dysfunction among individuals in MMT [12]–[20]. As early as in 1972, Cushman et al. and Brown et al. found that a respective 30% and 14% of their male patients on MMT reported erectile dysfunction [12], [20]. Studies have not established whether methadone itself or whether other factors during MMT are the cause of sexual dysfunction. Decreases in plasma testosterone, methadone dose, age, and depression have been suggested as the contributing factors to sexual dysfunction, but previous studies have not consistently demonstrated these mechanisms [15], [16], [18], [20].Many studies show higher rates of sexual dysfunction in men on MMT than in the general population [15]–[18]. Few studies have examined whether the sexual dysfunction increases or decreases among individuals who are receiving MMT compared with that in MMT-naive heroin-dependent individuals. Hanbury et al. found 33% of 50 men reported sexual dysfunction shortly after initiating MMT, most of whom had experienced similar difficulties when using heroin [13].Most studies in China on MMT patients are limited to characteristics of sexual behavior, such as the frequency of sexual activity, the number of sexual partners, and condom use [21], [22]. Few studies have examined the male sexual function change during MMT. This article aims to assess the level of sexual dysfunction in heroin-dependent men before and after MMT initiation, to determine the prevalence and change of sexual dysfunction, and to explore the influencing factors by assessing behavioral, psychological and social factors.
