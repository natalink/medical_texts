The female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is defined as a persistent and recurrent disorder of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm and pain[1]. FSD is a relatively common disorder, and the prevalence of FSD is reported to be 44–55% in premenopausal Korean women[2, 3]. Female sexual function is associated with multidimensional factors, including anatomical, physiological, psychological and social factors[3–6], and can affect the quality of life and interpersonal relationships[7].Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by lipid infiltration inside the hepatocyte in the absence of viral hepatitis or excessive alcohol consumption, and is the most prevalent cause of chronic liver disease. The reported prevalence of NAFLD is 20 to 30% in Western countries[8] and 12 to 33% in Korea[6, 9]. NAFLD includes a wide spectrum of liver disorders from simple non-alcoholic fatty liver to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, which can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma[8]. In recent decades NAFLD was reported to have significant impact on public health, and a body of evidences has suggested the association of NAFLD with type 2 diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease[10].In terms of burden of illness, the impact of NAFLD on the quality of life is an important issue, and previous studies have suggested that patients with NAFLD have lower scores in the quality of life[11, 12]. Although one previous report suggested that NAFLD is a risk factor for sexual dysfunction in a male animal model, there is a paucity of information about the impact of NAFLD on female sexual dysfunction[13].The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between NAFLD and female sexual dysfunction in premenopausal women.
