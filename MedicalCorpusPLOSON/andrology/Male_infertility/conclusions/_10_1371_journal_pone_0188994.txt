Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection satisfactory for the completion of sexual activity [1]. ED is a prevalent health condition, which is estimated to affect 17.7–18.4% men aged ≥ 20 years in the USA [2,3] and 32.2% in Europe [4], may be episodic or chronic, and can be associated with other sexual dysfunctions including reduced sexual desire and premature ejaculation [5]. Common risk factors for ED encompass age, obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, lower urinary tract symptoms, hypertension, low physical activity, smoke [2,4], psychiatric conditions and psychological factors [5].Opioids may increase sexual desire in the short term [6], but their long term use is known to negatively impact on sexual function and to lead to erectile dysfunction (ED) [7,8]. Various studies explored ED in men on opioid replacement therapy (ORT) and reported a 21–52% prevalence [7,9–11], with a peak of approximately 80% in a longitudinal study on a small group of patients in China [12]. Most studies were on small samples of men on ORT, but a meta-analysis suggested that factors associated with sexual dysfunction include age, familial status, medical comorbidity, psychiatric illness, testosterone levels, opioid dosage, duration of treatment, and other current substance use disorders [13].The majority of studies on ED were conducted on men under methadone maintenance treatment, and a meta-analysis indicated a 52% pooled prevalence for sexual dysfunction among methadone users [11]. Buprenorphine was introduced more recently as an alternative ORT [8]. European data indicate that methadone is prescribed in approximately 63% of patients, while buprenorphine is prescribed in 37% of them, although these figures differ greatly from country to country [14]. There is agreement that substitution treatment, either methadone or buprenorphine, may improve ED in opioid users [6,15].Pharmacodynamics of methadone and buprenorphine differ, in that the former is a μ-opioid receptor agonist, while the latter is a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid that acts on the μ-opioid receptor with low intrinsic activity and high affinity, and on the κ-opioid receptor with no intrinsic activity but high affinity [7,8].Human and animal data indicate that opioids may act at different sites in the hypothalamic–pituitary axis, and lead to opioid associated androgen deficiency (OPIAD), an endocrine dysfunction that includes increase of prolactin and decrease of follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, estradiol, and oxytocin [16,17]. OPIAD results in hypogonadism, and is reported to occur after a few weeks of opioid intake and when exceeding a daily oral morphine milligram equivalent dosage (OMMED) of 100 mg [17]. Animal data suggest lower risk of OPIAD with buprenorphine than methadone probably through the offset of hypothalamic–pituitary axis inhibition related to κ-opioid receptor antagonist activity [18]. Data from humans are discordant, in that some studies reported more frequent sexual and ED to methadone, while other ones found no significant differences between the two maintenance treatments [7–9,19,20].Sexual functioning is an important determinant of quality of life (QoL), but the effect of ED on QoL has been seldom explored in men under ORT [8,21,22].The aims of the present cross-sectional multicentre study are to explore the prevalence and severity of ED in patients under methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment, the factors related to ED, and the impact of ED on patient’s QoL. To this aim, we recruited a large sample of patients, collected data on a number of demographic, clinical, and psychopathological factors, and explored their role as predictors of ED and QOL through univariate and multivariate analysis.
