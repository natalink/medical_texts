Overall, the IIEF-5 and PEDT are two feasible and useful instruments for self-assessment of ED and PE. All the items fit well in their embedded construct without serious local ependency. In addition, no items displayed substantial DIF, suggesting that both instruments can be used in respondents from various demographic backgrounds. However, a certain degree of score disordering could be detected in both instruments, and future studies will need to further examine whether using a 4-point Likert scale could perform better than the current 5-point Likert scale.
