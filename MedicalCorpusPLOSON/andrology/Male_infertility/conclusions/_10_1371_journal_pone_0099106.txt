Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system which particularly affects young women. The male to female ratio ranges between 1∶2–3 [1], [2] and, while incidence seems to increase in general [3], [4], it seems to increase even stronger in women [5]. First symptoms typically arise between the third and fifth decade of life which overlaps with the period of reproduction and family planning. Assuming a prevalence in Europe of 70–80/100.000 during the third and fourth decade [1], there are estimated to be 250.000 female MS patients of fertile age in Europe. Hence, there is a great need of patients for counseling about inheritance risk, sexual dysfunctions, influence of MS on a pregnancy, birth and lactation, but also vice versa about the effect of pregnancy on the MS course.In the past, especially during the first half of 20th century, female patients were often discouraged from becoming mother as pregnancy was considered to be a risk in MS [6]. Although some studies may suggest that MS increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [7], [8], the majority of studies could show that risk of complications during pregnancy and birth outcome is the same as in healthy women [9], [10]. Many patients in our outpatient department and in MS internet forums report that they received the advice to deliver by caesarean section although current studies show that it is not necessarily preferable to vaginal delivery in MS patients [11], [12]. Patients report to be frequently advised against peridural anesthesia, although it is well documented that peridural anaesthesia does not increase post partum relapse rate and can be used in MS patients too [13]. The problem of sexual dysfunction seems to be often underestimated as either patients do not report these symptoms or physicians do not routinely ask for them [14]. Briefly summarized, increasing data regarding MS and pregnancy has become available in the literature during the last years [15]. However, it is not known to what extent these findings are transferred into today’s clinical routine.The uncertainties among patients and attending physicians also apply to handling of MS pharmacotherapy. Within the last years pregnancy registries could show that exposure to interferon beta (IFN-β) and glatiramer acetate (GA) during conception and even during pregnancy seems to be relatively safe [16], [17]. However, it is commonly agreed to discontinue IFN- β or GA treatment when pregnancy is detected. Limited data concerning pregnancy is available for the monoclonal antibody natalizumab and the sphingosine receptor modulator fingolimod [18], [19]. Mitoxantrone is known for teratogenic effects, and its withdrawal is recommended in female as well as in male patients at least six months before pregnancy. Until now, there are no reliable data whether it is favorable to start immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) directly after delivery instead of nursing or to postpone IMT in favor of breastfeeding [20], [21].Taken together, MS patients that plan to conceive or are already pregnant have currently unmet needs in terms of guidance. As obstetricians are usually not experienced in MS counseling and, vice versa, neurologists have only little knowledge regarding obstetrics, pregnant MS patients may have difficulties to get competent advice.This study surveys neurologists as main source of information for pregnant MS patients regarding delivery, course of the disease and medication during pregnancy, child birth and lactation.
