The present study provides useful evidence for the development of empirically-derived disorder classification and treatment approaches. We demonstrated that body-related problems characterize a phenotypically distinct factor and that the relationship between this factor and other internalizing and externalizing symptoms may be understood in light of a general latent dimension of psychopathology. Moreover, we described an interconnection between anger and attitudes towards food, self-image and sexuality. We measured higher levels of each of these indicators in women, as well as higher levels of the Body construct in middle-aged individuals. Altogether, the present results motivate further research on the etiological and clinical implications of cross-disorder, gender- and age-specific patterns of body-related symptoms.
