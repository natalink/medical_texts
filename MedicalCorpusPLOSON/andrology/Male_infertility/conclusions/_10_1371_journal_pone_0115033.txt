Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder, affecting approximately 4% of the male and 2% of the female middle-aged adults [1]. The characteristics of OSA are intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. The pathogenesis of OSA is the interaction of the following factors: anatomical abnormality of upper airway and ventilator control instability [2].Accumulating evidence showed that OSA is correlated with endocrinal dysfunction, disorder of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis [3]–[8], Sexual dysfunction, particularly erectile dysfunction (ED), is common in OSA men [9], and ED can been ameliorated via continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the standard treatment modality of OSA [10], [11]. Testosterone is one of sexual hormones and terminal part of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Robust evidence confirmed that low testosterone is tightly associated with sexual dysfunction [12], and testosterone administration can improve sexual dysfunction in men [13], [14]. Several studies found that low serum testosterone levels were observed in patients with OSA [15]–[17]. Some investigations indicated that testosterone administration, however, aggravates the severity of OSA [18], [19]. Previous data recommended that CPAP can improve sexual dysfunction and endocrinal disorder [10], [11], [20], [21], however, whether serum testosterone levels may be ameliorated or not by CPAP is unclear.The aim of the present meta-analysis was to quantitatively evaluate the impact of CPAP on testosterone in men with OSA.
