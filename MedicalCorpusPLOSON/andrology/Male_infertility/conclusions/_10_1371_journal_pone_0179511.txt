Despite significant advances in the management of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) including renal replacement therapy and the increasing availability of newer and more effective pharmacological interventions, there has been no marked improvement in patient survival, which remains 3–4 years on average [1–7]. Depression, pain, pruritus, impaired sleep, and fatigue are commonly reported by people undergoing long-term hemodialysis [8–10]. In addition, sexual dysfunction is also very common in both men and women with ESKD [11], is associated with anxiety and depression, and may affect quality of life through effects on self-confidence, self-esteem and self-image [12–14].However, previous research in this area has principally focused on erectile dysfunction in men, while sexual dysfunction among women on hemodialysis has received less attention [11]. Our Collaborative Working Group on Depression and Sexual dysfunction (CDS) in Hemodialysis has previously conducted a large scale study (involving 1472 women) to examine the prevalence and correlates of low self-reported sexual functioning in women treated with hemodialysis [15]. In the CDS study, four out of five women reported Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scores consistent with low sexual functioning (84%). Although this previous study showed a high prevalence of low sexual functioning in this clinical setting, an analysis of the individual domains of sexual functioning (desire, arousal, lubrication, overall satisfaction with sexual life and pain) has not been previously reported.Exploring the characteristics of individual sexual functioning domains may contribute to an improved understanding of the specific sexual experiences of women, when treated with hemodialysis, to inform a patient-centered research agenda. In this study, we assessed the prevalence and correlates of the individual domains of sexual functioning in women treated with hemodialysis within the same cohort of patients involved in the CDS study.
