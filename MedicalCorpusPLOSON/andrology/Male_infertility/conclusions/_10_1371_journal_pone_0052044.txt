Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common yet poorly understood condition, with significant economic costs and severe impact on the quality of life of diagnosed patients [1], [2]. The prevalence was estimated between 2.2% and 13.8% [3], [4]. A population-based survey has shown the prevalence of CP/CPPS-like symptoms to be 4.5% in China [5]. Symptoms of this condition include chronic pain, voiding symptoms, and pelvic, sexual and psychosocial disturbances, among others [6]. To date, no single specific therapy is effective in all patients. The major reason for this is that patients with CP/CPPS are not a homogenous group with a single disease process who respond in the same way to specific medications, but rather a heterogeneous group of unique individuals with widely different etiological mechanism(s), disease characteristics, symptom complexes, and progression trajectories. It is therefore rational to evaluate CP/CPPS patients as individuals with differing clinical phenotypes. However, no validated predictors or biomarkers are currently available that help classify those patients in a way that could guide therapy. In 2009, Shoskes et al [7] developed a 6-point clinical phenotyping system called UPOINT to classify patients with CPPS and interstitial cystitis and subsequently direct appropriate therapy. The clinical domains are urinary symptoms, psychosocial dysfunction, organ specific findings, infection, neurological/systemic, and tenderness of muscles. Each domain has been clinically defined, linked to specific mechanisms of symptom production or propagation, and associated with specific therapy. This phenotype is qualitative, with each domain scored as yes or no. The major finding of the first UPOINT retrospective study was the strong correlation between the number of UPOINT positive domains and the NIH-CPSI total score in each patient [8], which was further verified by other studies [9], [10]. More recently, the UPOINT-guided multimodal therapy has been shown to significantly improve symptoms [11].It is widely acknowledged that CP/CPPS is associated with significant sexual dysfunction [12], [13]. Erectile dysfunction (ED), defined as the consistent inability to obtain and/or maintain a penile erection sufficient for adequate sexual performance, is the most investigated sexual dysfunction in patients with CP/CPPS [12], [13]. The reported ED prevalence findings for CP/CPPS sufferers ranged from 15.0% to 48.3% [14], [15], varying with the evaluation tools and populations. However, the original UPOINT phenotype system did not include a domain for sexual dysfunction or ED. A Swedish study recently showed that the number of positive UPOINT domains was not correlated with ED severity in CP/CPPS patients [9]. The impact of adding a sexual dysfunction or ED domain to the UPOINT system on patients symptoms is also conï¬‚icting [10], [16].For international validation and adoption of this novel UPOINT algorithm a prospective study was conducted in a Chinese cohort of males with CP/CPPS. We sought to determine the clinical phenotype of those Chinese CP/CPPS patients using the UPOINT classification system and assessed the frequency of individual domains and their effect on symptom severity and erectile function. Also, we aimed to further investigate the impact of adding an ED domain to create a modified UPOINT phenotyping system on symptom severity of CP/CPPS patients.
