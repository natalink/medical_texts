This study presents data about long term outcome of micturition, defecation and sexual function in CES after decompression and is unique in three aspects 1) markedly large cohort 2) lengthy follow up 3) integral evaluation of defecation and sexual function next to micturition. This report demonstrates dysfunction to be extremely common years after surgery and communicates a clear demand from CES patients for more information about their prognosis on those functions. Without doubt, the presented data adds substantially to the current knowledge about CES. It gives the clinician in spinal care the opportunity to inform CES patients realistically about long term recovery of micturition, defecation and sexual function after decompressive surgery. With regard to the seriousness of genito-urinary and defecation dysfunction and impact on quality of life, a prospective study is necessary to evaluate the risk of permanent deficit and to identify predictive variables, which can be influenced by intervention and personal guidance in rehabilitation.
