Epidemiological studies worldwide have documented that erectile dysfunction (ED) is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) in men. [1–6] Early diagnosis of ED and the identification of its risk factors, particularly in men with type 2 DM (T2DM), can provide useful information for stratifying cardiovascular risk as well. A recent meta-analysis of 12 studies demonstrated that ED is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease, and peripheral vascular diseases. [7] Risk was found to be independent of age, metabolic control, body-mass index (BMI, weight in kg divided by height in meters squared), and duration of the condition, emphasizing the importance of ED screening and its early detection in the diabetic male population. [7]Despite this evidence, the presence of ED in diabetic men is still poorly evaluated in routine clinical practice for several reasons. Men with ED, and particularly those with T2DM, are reluctant to report the condition to their doctor. [8] Moreover, physicians have identified multiple barriers to managing ED in their practice, [8–9] making it difficult even for healthcare professionals to enquire about ED in routine diabetes care. [10] In line with these data, a previous Danish study showed that only 33% of men with T2DM reported that their general practitioner had brought up sexuality in the consultation. [11] Similar findings from a study by Bjerggaard et al. [12] showed that about half of sexually inactive men with T2DM felt that their sexual life did not meet their sexual needs; the study also found that sexual distress was more common among sexually inactive than sexually active men. [12]The true incidence of ED in the male diabetic population remains largely unknown. According to a large-scale study conducted by Fedele et al. [8] and involving 1010 male diabetic patients, the crude incidence of ED at a mean follow-up of 2.8 years was 68 cases per 1000 person-years, more than two-fold that estimated in the general population. A higher incidence (166.3 per 1000 person-years) was reported by De Berardis et al. [9] in another Italian survey that enrolled 670 men with T2DM followed every 6 months for up to 3 years. Conversely, a lower incidence (25/1000 person-years) was reported by Klein et al. [10] in a 10-year cumulative U.S. study in 264 type 1 DM men who were less than 30 years of age at diagnosis of diabetes.T2DM is a costly disease affecting approximately 6.5% of native adults in Italy. [13] Treatment can prevent some of its devastating complications but does not usually restore normoglycemia or eliminate the adverse consequences altogether. [14–15] Since the current methods of treating diabetes remain inadequate, prevention is essential for early diagnosis in at-risk populations and to reduce its chronic complications. Lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin have been found to reduce the incidence of diabetes in persons at high risk. [15] Similarly, control of comorbidities and lifestyle modifications are associated with improvements in ED. [16]Epidemiological data can inform prevention strategies and allocation of adequate resources. We previously reported the prevalence of ED and its correlates in a sample of male patients with new or recently diagnosed T2DM (<24 months) attending diabetes care centers affiliated with the Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD; the SUBITO-DE study). [17–18] We extended our analysis and now present longitudinal data from the same study after a mean follow-up of 18 months.
